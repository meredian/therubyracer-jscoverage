therubyracer  + JSCoverage
==========================

This repo represents working snippet, showing how [JSCoverage](http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/) can be integrated with [therubyracer](https://github.com/cowboyd/therubyracer) for javascript code coverage measuring.

While repo state is far from perfect, it's 100% usable.

My next turn was to integrate JSCoverage-wrapper with [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) reporting tool - it has much more beautiful interface. There's class left for this, but it requires a bit modified code of JSCoverage module
